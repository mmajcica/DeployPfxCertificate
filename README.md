# Deploy Pfx Certificate

## Overview

This extension will add a Build/Release task in your TFS/VSTS instance that will allow you to generate Pickles documentation. Task ships with the necessary Pickles executable files.

## Requirements

No specific requirements are present for this task to run.

## The different parameters of the task are explained below:

* **Feature Directory**: Directory to start scanning recursively for features.
* **Documentation Format**: Allows the user to select what format the generated output will be written in. E.g. HTML, Word, DHTML, Excel, etc.
* **Output Directory**: The folder where Pickles will put the generated output. If not specified, by default, is going to be persisted in AGENT_BUILDDIRECTORY in case of a build, meanwhile in case of a release it is going to be placed in AGENT_RELEASEDIRECTORY
* **System Under Test Name**: This is the name of the system under test. Since Pickles is designed to be used with any platform/language that supports Gherkin feature files we cannot rely on reading in an assembly or a jar file to retrieve metadata about the system under test. Instead, The user can use this argument to name the system under test.
* **System Under Test Version**: This is the version of the system under test. Since Pickles is designed to be used with any platform/language that supports Gherkin feature files we cannot rely on reading in an assembly or a jar file to retrieve metadata about the system under test. Instead, The user can use this argument to set a version number for the system under test.
* **Test Results File**: Path to the XML results file. The filename itself can be a wildcard as defined by the searchpattern of the .NET Directory.GetFiles() method. For selecting multiple resultsfiles to be processed, you can use the wildcard searchpattern, you can enter the files as a semicolon separated list or a combination of both. Selecting only a path to a folder will not work, when all files in a folder needs to be selected, append a * to the path.
* **Test Results Format**: The format used for the report coming out of the test run of the features. There are many different testing frameworks supported by SpecFlow, plus all of the other gherkin style frameworks out there. NUnit and xUnit output formats are accepted as well as output from MsTest and SpecRun. As of version 2.4, Pickles also supports output from VsTest.Console.exe, the new command line runner introduced by Visual Studio 2012.
* **Language**: Allows the user to tell Pickles the default language of the .feature files. Any language settings inside the .feature files take precedence.
* **Enable Comments**: As of version 2.6, Pickles includes Gherkin #-style comments. As of version 2.7, this inclusion is configurable.
* **Include Experimental Features**: As of version 2.5, Pickles includes experimental features. The goal of experimental features is to get rapid feedback about ideas. They are subject to change or removal at any time. The experimental features are not always completely thought through - including them and receiving feedback about them enables us to make better decisions about those features. This argument is a flag. Including the argument means that the experimental features should be included. If the argument is not included, then the experimental features will not be included.

## Release notes

* 1.0.2 - Improved markdown file. No changes for the build task
* 1.0.1 - Minor improvements on the extension. No changes for the build task
* 1.0.0 - Initial Release - Ships with Pickles 2.18.0
